## Description

I this project we had to create a react app that is a single page portfolio. In the app will an about me section, a contact section, a protfolio section, and a resume section. I first started the project by giving the npm command "npx create-react-app" to create the initial set up of the app its self I then created the css to contain the colors and styl of the website with in the app.css file. I then set up the app.js which will contain all of the initial jsx of the of the web app and contain the structure of the of the webapp. After importing react and all of the components I then create the function app and set up the different sections as categories and create an index for them, before the final return I create a hook for the current category and set i to about me. In the return statement I set up the Nav component and give it categories and the hook methods as props. In the main section I create an Iternary that will return the right section. The last thing I have returned is the footer. In the navigation component I bring in the props and create the header and the seperate categories for chosing the sections in the return statement. I then create the about me component which contains an image of me, a short introduction, and my skill set. I next created the contact me component. I first make a hook for the form component and make the different components of the form from the hook. I then create a hook for the error message. I then create the functions for the submit and change for the form that will take in a name, email, and message. the I return the jsx that will give my email github and linkedIn and the form itself. I then created the portfolio which goes through all of the projects I have created and gits the demo and the repo of project. I then created the resume component that gives my education and work history as well as a link to a pdf of my resume. The final component I created was the footer component which is simply a header that contains the links to my github, linkedIn, and Facebook.

# React generated readme
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
